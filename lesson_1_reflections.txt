How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it showed the changes i didnt do!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    suppose we made some changes which we didnt like, we can revert back with help of vc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro : 1. havin to commit only after some logically(respectfully) changes done

    cons : 1. forget to commit
    		2. unneccessarily commiting too much or too less

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    its easier to keep track of files this way

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    u can use git log & scroll as u need;
    git diff to see the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i can make way more changes now without worry

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for my new project
